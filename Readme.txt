This project is based on sockets and allows remote screen sharing (No keyboard action integrated as of rn).
The client will connect to the server and initate a screen sharing procedure. (Only if the server owner accepts it)

The server is multi-threaded and allows multiple connections at once. (Each client is ran on a seperate thread)
