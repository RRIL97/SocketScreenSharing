This project is based on sockets and allows remote screen sharing (No keyboard action integrated as of rn).
You simply run the server on a computer that you want to share the screen from.
The client will connect to the server and initate a screen sharing procedure. (Only if the server owner accepts it)


The server is multi-threaded and allows multiple connections & streams.
